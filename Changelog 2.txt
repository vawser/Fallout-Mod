FUTURE PATCH IDEAS 
 -- Bugfix Patch - After finishing P3 of this patch --
 
 -- Bright Lights and the Big City (Vegas region and government focus) -- 
 - Rework New Vegas, some ideas include: 
	. Custom estates? turn factions into estates, use other estate mechanics via other factions? Or keep as current? 
	. Free Vegas Ecconomic Zone (rework old code done)
	. Vegas Mission Tree (already coded one for older bookmark, needs to be redone for new also before release)
	. Fix broken content
 - Unique Boomer Government 
 - Boomer Missions - Rework old code
 - Unique Sporeling Government 
 - Freeside events (Mostly old code, theres around 10 events at various levels of completion)
 - Add new government reforms and mechanics (largely just rejigging older code but with some specific mechanics via interface also)
 - Rework the Boneyard 
 - Followers Mechanics 
 - Utobithia Events 
 
 -- Mini Patch -- 
 - Bugfixes 
 - Sundogs content (special units, a few events)
 - 
 
 -- Vault Tec Calling -- 
  - Reworked Institutions
  - Vault Experimnent System
  - Another Map overhaul focusing on the Commonwealth
  - Add content from tabletop RPG (prep work to that already done in one bookmark) 
  - Add numerous advisors from games 
  - Tenpenny events (Rework of old content)
  - Vault 101 content
  - Rework The Pitt
  
 -- Van Buren --
  - Rework Midwest 
  - Add Van Buren content as works with bookmarks and map
  - Content for the Big Empty
  - Ronto Content
  - System for Legion breakaway tribes 
  - Redo tribal and raider events
  - Boulder Dome content
  - Add a custom faith for the Abbey 
  
-- To Do -- 
Add local for mission tree #80% finished
Consider adding more lines for the Follow-Chalk evbent line and more options in individual events
Add custom tooltip for Follows-Chalk events if option will keep eventline going or guarenteed death
Add custom tooltip for Follows-Chalk event at Skynet if he becomes a vessel for Skynet - Skynet feature placeholder till later reform to Skynet nation 
Get more events ready (around 20-40 are probably feasable in this or the next patch from old code. Consider balance and bookmarks. Make sure most content per patch applies to main bookmark. 
Special units for the Eighties - Ties into mission tree
Fix capital bug with Broken Hill
Fix old local issue with Shi

BOOKMARK NOTES 
 - There are a few dozen events already in the mod that should not appear in 'wild wasteland' bookmark. I will go over and add bookmark triggers. I have over 100 events I worked on over the last couple of years that need tweaks but are either 'courier' bookmark specific or releasable country specific
 - Repurposes (for the courier bookmark) Scorpion Bites tag (migrated to new Monte Carlo prov in NVG). Is in old position in Wild Wasteland 
 - Add more 'frontier' nations for NCR to state in Courier bookmark, consider further breaking up sections
 
IDEAS
 - Ratnest prov has potential for future flavour for ratspeakers
 - Flavour event for Fausts staff? 
 - Unique estate via event option for NCR If they own the Mojave Express and they dont exist? 
 - Aformentioned Building-tradegood rework? 
 - Do something with Divide (outside of small stuff in Mojave Express missions)
	. More countries and provinces - Monster country? 
	. Formable Divide 
	. Some sort of Ulyssus Event line? 
	. Maybe something special for Radstone if it conquers it?
 - Do something with The Glow
 - Radstone - Broken Hill event line
 - Add some OPM 'remnant' NCR settlements (Redding, Sactown etc) for the NCR to use its mechanic on. 
 - Formable Masters Amy country for Militant Mutant Countries that follow the Unity Religion
 - Formable Unity for religious mutant countries that follow the Unity Religion 

Planning (for after this patch)
Add following countries: 
 - Jackals (Borderegion of NCR) 
Continue working through old work (clean code etc)
Give Skynet unique government, Add custom government reform rank for Skynet which allows it to augment its system with a biological componant or maintain entirely robotic base (options locked behind option chosen in event at gamestart), tie in with Follows-Chalk as a option unlocked via eventline
Rework Follows-Chalk eventline so AI prioritises sending towards player country
Add and rebalance some Legion content 
Expand karma effects in events
