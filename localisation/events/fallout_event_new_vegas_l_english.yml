Lost forever is his bounty of knowledge concerning human longevity, the depth and breadth of which could, as he was apt to say, 'fill several text books'. He was not exaggerating.\n\nAlso lost forever are House's singular personality, force of will, vision, and leadership ability. The probability of an equally capable figure emerging from the current human population to lead mankind to a future of equivalent quality is less than 0.000112% by objective measures too complex to detail in this obituary.\n\n -Will revise and finish this up later.Obit makes salient points but 'pearls before swine,' of course.
