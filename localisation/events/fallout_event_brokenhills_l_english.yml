 brokenhills.1.title: "Decline Of Broken Hills"
 brokenhills.1.desc: "Broken Hills has fallen onto hard times. The Uranium mine has dried up, leaving our population destitute and without stable employment. Many super mutants have left the settlement, following former Broken Hills Mayor Marcus to found §YJacobstown §!. \n\nThe collapse of the §YNew California Republic §!(NCR) had little impact on us, having been neglected and largely forgotten by the greater NCR even before its collapse, with our diminished resources becoming a burden on the struggling republic. Our defacto independence should grant us the ability to try and resolve the crisis in Broken Hills on our own terms."
 brokenhills.1.option.a: "We just need to dig deeper!" 
 brokenhills.1.option.b: "Our mining days are over, we need to diversify!"
